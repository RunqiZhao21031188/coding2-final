What is the relationship between life and the universe? Maybe you ask a scientist and he'll give you one answer, ask a philosopher and he'll give you another answer. As for how people view the connection between the universe and life, I define it as the process of everyone searching for the id. We are more like a local universe with self-consciousness.

If I had to define it, I would define the relationship between life and the universe as “breed”. I want to make a work that shows the connection between life and the universe.


## BGM

When the program starts, the music automatically plays along with the movement. The melody wants to highlight a sense of wonder, energy and secrecy.

## The color

In this work, I borrowed the style of Pop art and adopted bold colors of yellow, blue, pink and black, hoping to distinguish the atmosphere of the whole work from the universe known to people, which is mysterious and unpredictable.

## Element

The whole work consists of two objects, one large and one small.
Small objects, which I would call cells, shake and move like the birth of a life - flexible, changeable, full of vigor and vitality. Every now and then exercise is like the birth of a new life.
The big objects play the role of the universe and the uterus, it is sometimes absent, but always around to give a sense of security.

When you zoom in to dots, the universe becomes a dot, and you, me, and everyone is in it

## The grid

The intersection of each grid is more like the stars of the universe, which represent order, predictability, permanence and, in some ways, comfort. Another way of looking at it is that they are doing seemingly random motions with some regularity, individuals of these motions


## Coding

Function:
Use "mousePressed" to control mouse interaction. The background changes from yellow to black the first time the mouse moves, and pink when the mouse is released. It stays pink until you click the mouse to change it to a black background.

Add music with "my sound.load" and the music plays when the program starts

Use "int" to control the size range of the display graph

"OfNoise" and "ofGetFrameNum" are used to control the frequency and size of explosions

Set the parameters and colors of all objects and backgrounds as well as the rotation speed.
